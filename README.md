#Boris Bikes: Week 1 Project At Makers Academy
Boris Bikes allows users to borrow and return bikes from docking stations, 
which are serviced by vans, which take damaged bikes to a garage to be fixed 
before returning to the docking station again.

## Languages and Tools
This system was built in Ruby, using Rspec testing in Chicago style TDD.

### To Open
In your terminal:
```
	git clone git@github.com:barr-code/boris_bikes.git
```

### To Run Tests
```
rspec
```


Notes: This was my very first real programming project. It represents my first exposure to the
Rspec testing suite. It taught me how to make classes interact with one another in Ruby, and is
something I still refer back to when I am working on more complex projects or explaining elements of Ruby
to others.
